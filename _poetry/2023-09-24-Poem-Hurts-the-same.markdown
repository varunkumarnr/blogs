We had books filled with the stories of our future, <br>
You burned them before we can even start a chapter. <br>
Our plans were grand, ambitious but they were always together, <br>
How can I accomplish them without your arm on my shoulder. <br>

Every moment we spend, every walk we had felt like stuff made in dreams, <br>
But now I only see you in dream. <br>
You read all my writings with a smile, and promised you will always be there, <br>
I would write thousand poems, just to walk another mile. <br>

It was our first Valentine, you wore a beautiful long red gown, <br>
Your smile made the fresh roses look dull, <br>
You took the flowers, told they smell wonderful, <br>
I thought I just found an angel. <br>

The same face that put a smile, now made my breath weak, <br>
Your angelic voice is now distinct, <br>
Your everyday messages are now just memories, <br>
Been a year but **still hurts the same**, now I don't have your shoulder to cry upon. <br>

I know you have moved on with someone new, <br>
My friends tell me I should do the same, <br>
Little do they know, that i still have a part of you, <br>
How did you kill the part of me? <br>
