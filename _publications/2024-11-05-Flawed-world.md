## prologue

I always wanted to get started on learning more about agriculture, and, surprise—you can’t learn agriculture just from reading books; you actually need to work on a farm. I live in the city and am not rich enough to afford a farm here, so I started looking at other options. Ram (not his real name), a distant family member, is a middleman between farmers and sellers in local markets—the guy who does the least work but earns the most out of the three. I asked Ram if he could help, and since I had some festival holidays coming up, it would be the perfect time to start learning. For some reason, Ram agreed and arranged for me to visit a rural village about 350 kilometers from the city. He even set up a place for me to stay with his close family members. They might be my distant family too, though I’m not really sure how that works.

Getting to the village is an adventure in itself. There are no direct buses; you have to get off in a different village and then walk through two other villages to reach it—around 3 kilometers in total. The buses only run twice a day, and I’m still not sure of the exact timings. There’s no network or internet connectivity in the village, and to get the nearest signal, I have to walk 500 meters just to see two bars. I’ll need that, since I lied to my mother about where I was going and will have to call her now and then.

I left home Wednesday night, not really prepared and feeling kind of nervous—I’d be staying with people I didn’t even know. I reached the village at 10 a.m., after being repeatedly warned not to miss the bus, since the next one wouldn’t arrive until evening.

The family I’m staying with is a family of three: mom, dad, and a five-year-old son. They live in a small house with a roof made of coconut leaves, mainly because they’re hardly ever home—they’re always out working on the farm. When I arrived, they were already at the farm, so their five-year-old son took me there, which was less than a kilometer away. They have a small tomato farm and a field where they grow flowers. They usually spend the entire day there and return home late at night for dinner and sleep. The son, who’s in 1st grade, also helps on the farm as soon as school is done.

I’m getting a bit sidetracked here. The purpose of writing this blog isn’t to explain how I spent my holiday but rather to share what I learned from it—and also to hold my future self accountable.

In this short time, I’ve learned a lot of things, though not a single one is directly related to agriculture. I’m not sure how to structure this without turning it into a novel or a story, so I’ll try to keep it brief and simply share the lessons I learned, along with the experiences that led to each conclusion.

## Day 1

The whole first day, I just explored the fields and village. In the evening, I helped with picking flowers and putting them into baskets, which would be sent to the market the next day. Once we were done picking, we returned, had a nice dinner since it was Diwali, and then went to bed. That night, it rained, and because the roof is made of coconut leaves, the whole house was leaking. I remember they were more worried about me feeling uncomfortable than about themselves or their child, even though I kept telling them I was fine. Once the rain stopped, they cleaned up the floor and didn’t let me help. As the floor was still wet, a scorpion came crawling inside, which the five-year-old squashed with his school shoe. I felt so useless just watching all of this.

## Day 2

The next morning, I insisted on helping, so they let me take the milk to the dairy. When I got there with the boy, there was a small line since we arrived early. At the dairy, they measured the milk but said it was too warm or something—I’m not sure. The villagers behind me, probably noticing I was new to this (maybe from the way I was dressed or from me freaking out, not knowing what to do), helped me out and suggested I wait a few minutes and try again. They even let me cut to the front of the line after I’d waited 10 minutes—pretty sweet of them. This time, they accepted the milk. I also spoke to a few people and explained why I was there; they seemed quite happy about it, and a few even invited me to their homes.

## Day 3

Then I went to the farm, plucked tomatoes, sold them to Ram in the evening, and went home to sleep. The next day, Saturday, was my last day staying with them; I had to cut my stay short because I couldn’t get bus tickets for Sunday due to the festival holiday. So they bought chicken and a lungi for me, even though I’d never worn one before. I later realized they bought this from the money they earned working in the field the whole day before. We ate and then went to the field, where I learned how to distribute borewell water to the entire field. We returned home early, and soon it was time for me to leave.

I offered them money for letting me stay with them, but they refused, even though I insisted. It was a good sum of money too; during my three days there, I had assumed they were being nice because they expected me to pay, like how hotels work. That’s what I discussed with Ram as well—that I could pay anyone who helped me.

Taking the money would have helped them; they could have probably paid their son’s school fees with it. But they still wouldn’t accept it. So the question remains: why did they help me, a stranger? I would probably never even go back there, so what did they gain?

I’ve always believed that no one in this world will talk to you unless they want something. It could be anything—your intelligence, your looks, your money—but no one reaches out without expecting something in return. I can hardly remember a handful of times when people have called just to talk, with no other reason. No one really cares.

This experience felt even more unexpected because I was reading the book _The Selfish Gene_, which discusses how evolution inherently drives everything to be selfish. If you’re not selfish, you won’t succeed in natural selection—or so the theory goes.

Also those people are so good and generous they will never succeed in life, because the world is flawed. Just look around people that have everything are the people that are trying to get more things, People that do not have minimal things like the family are just happy with what they have. Now bring both this people in a voting contest on whos life you would want to take none would what to be a farmer in rural village. If God would have given option for me to choose to be associated with a family, I would choose the rich family too and so will you.

After returning from the village, I went trekking, and on the bus ride back, I gave up my seat for an old woman. There was another old woman standing, and a whole row of seats became available, but three college students rushed to sit in them, ignoring the older women. So, what did I gain from enduring leg pain while standing for an hour and a half in a crowded bus? When there is no initiative in the world to show gratitude, why should I bother?

As the quote goes, “No king ever won by giving up his own life on the battlefield; he can only win by having other people give their lives so he can win.” This is life: you have to use other people to succeed and not care about others.

So, should I be generous or not? That’s a discussion for another day. But one thing is for sure: for the rest of my life, I will try to visit as many rural places as possible and meet as many people as I can. I’m not sure how I will do it, but I was looking into taking a course on rural development. All I know is that I will make it happen.
