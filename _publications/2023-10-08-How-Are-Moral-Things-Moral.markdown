Today, as I was reading 'Euthyphro' by Plato, the question arose:  '**What makes Moral acts Moral?**'.I was fascinated by this question. This blog aims to delve into answering this question. You can read the complete dialogue between Socartes and  Euthyphro by Plato [here](https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/introphil/chapter/euthyphro/#:~:text=In%20this%20dialogue%20by%20Plato,try%20and%20clarify%20his%20thinking.).

**Euthyphro Summary**<br>
"Euthyphro" is a book written by Plato, and it features a dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro in the year 399 BCE about 2400 years ago. The setting for this dialogue is the "Porch of the King Archon" in Athens, which essentially serves as a courthouse. Socrates found himself there because he had been accused of corrupting the youth of Greece, while Euthyphro was present to accuse his own father of killing someone. In this book, Socrates questions Euthyphro about whether he is acting morally by accusing his father.

Socrates approaches Euthyphro and asks if he is certain he is doing the right thing. To this, Euthyphro replies "yes", asserting that murder is not a morally righteous act. Socrates then proceeds to ask, "What defines morality?" Euthyphro offers several answers but ultimately concludes with the following statement: "Moral acts are those which are dear to the gods, and immoral acts are those which are not dear to the gods."

Socrates further questions, "Do acts become moral because the gods like them, or do the gods like them because they are moral?" Euthyphro contemplates this deeply and responds that the gods favor them because they are inherently moral. Socrates smirks and raises his right eyebrow corrects his glasses(IDK if he did all this). He says, gotcha Euthyphro "So you're asserting that the gods favor these acts because they are moral in themselves, independent of God's preference." Fool, your Euthyphro, If the gods' liking them isn't the reason for their morality, then what is? You have not addressed my initial question of What defines morality?." After this the dialogue between them ends with them talking about justice and holyness.

**Acts are moral because gods like them.**<br>
Let's explore the idea second possibilty of Euthyphro defination that "God's liking makes acts moral" with an example. Imagine you are driving a car, and suddenly, God appears, causing the entire universe to freeze except for you and God (we won't question how the world frooze because, because noone ever qustions god and belives everythingüòÑ). God tells you, "The rabbit's time here on Earth is done; you must run over it." You feel guilty and ask, "But God, is this a morally right thing to do?" God responds, "Nothing in your life has been more moral than this. The mere fact that I am saying this makes it moral." You are reassured and follow God's command, running over the cute, innocent rabbit.

Now, the question is, "Is this act moral?" If your answer is "Yes," you can stop reading the blog here your answer is "God liking Acts make them moral". If your answer is "No," then it implies that God's liking alone doesn't make an act moral. This leads us back to the fundamental question: "What defines morality?"

**Acts are moral because they are moral by law**<br>
Let's consider that moral acts are those that align with the law or the agreed by its citizens. Take, for example, the widely accepted beliefs that "Honesty is moral" and "Completing your responsibilities/promises is moral," which are enshrined in the law and agreed upon by most of us.

Now, let's delve into the first point: "Honesty is Virtous/moral." Imagine you and your friends have organized a surprise birthday party for a friend. When you pick up the birthday boy/girl, they inquire, "Where are we going?" Will you choose honesty, which is considered morally correct, or will you opt for a lie that ensures a positive outcome and doesn't spoil the surprise that you and your friends have prepared?

Consider the second point: "Completing your responsibilities/promises is moral." Imagine you borrow an axe from your friend and promise to return it in two days.Two days passed, Your friend as gone crazy and tells he wants to kill someone and asks for axe back. You had promised to return it in two days. Will you give it to him and fulfill your responsibility because it is the moral thing to do, or will you refuse and save a life?

If your answer is to be honest or give the axe to your friend, then your definition of morality aligns with "something that is moral by law or that most people agree upon." However, if your answer is the opposite, then the fundamental question remains: "What defines morality?"

**Acts are moral because they bring positive outcome** <br>
Let's consider that morality is something that brings about positive outcomes, as mentioned above, or in other words, something that "maximizes the balance of pleasure over pain" also known as utilitarianism or deontology. Consider this example: You live in a kingdom with an intelligent, smart king who has transformed the kingdom from poverty to the wealthiest in the world, providing its citizens with all the pleasures one could desire. Every citizen loves and admires him. However, one night, the king becomes drunk and kills an innocent soldier. The soldier's wife files a complaint in court, but the citizens are not happy about it. They argue that the king's actions occurred because he was intoxicated and should not be punished.

So what do you think could should do should it punish the king it is moral think to do but it would only bring happiness only to the soldier's wife while causing pain to the citizens, who have benefited from the king's rule and prosperity. Letting the king go without punishment, is not morally moral, but it would bring maximum pleasure to the citizens, therby agreeing with utilitarianism defination of morality.

So, what should the court decide? Should they let the king go free? If yes, it aligns with your definition that "morality is something that brings about positive outcomes or maximum pleasure." If the answer is different, then the fundamental question remains: "What defines morality?"

**What defines morality** The question of "What defines morality" was raised by Socrates around 2400 years ago and remains unanswered to this day. It makes us wonder about the progress of humanity when such fundamental questions remain elusive. Despite this, we continue to work on developing laws and judicial systems.

While people would debate and say there is no one single defination to morality I think everything in the world should have a defination, Unless you are "spiritual,"üßê each person tends to create their own random definition of spirituality to make themselves feel better and ignore realityüòÖ. Each of these definitions sound more absurd than the last. Common you and I both know there is only one universe you cant try to make your meanings and there is no deeper meaning.

I think it can be defined **"Morality is a concept that encompasses principles and behaviors influenced by societal consensus, legal norms, individual judgment, and the pursuit of positive outcomes."**(I am most probably wrong and would probably get destroyed by Socrates in debate for this defination).

Fundamental question still remains so "What exactly makes moral acts moral."ü§îüí≠
