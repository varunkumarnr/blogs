I had a day off from work and did what any normal person on a day off would do: I stared at an analog clock for an hour. Here's how it went, so you don't have to do it.

1. In the first few minutes of starting, I had the urge to go to sleep. I was not able to keep my eyes open.
2. I wanted to use my phone.
3. I randomly wanted to do tasks I thought were boring before, like cleaning, going to the market, or going out to eat alone.
4. I started wandering on thoughts and old memories even though I was actively trying not to.

SO WHY???

The brain is designed in such a way that it craves tasks that provide more dopamine or pleasure. These tasks are usually simple but offer a quick boost of dopamine. Activities that don't require much thinking or physical movement, like endlessly scrolling on a phone, provide more dopamine than, for example, going for a walk. Interestingly, sitting around daydreaming about all the things you want to do and watching motivational videos can give more dopamine than actually doing those tasks. So your tempted to scroll phone and daydream on couch.

You might be thinking, "Okay, Varun, stop. How is this related to staring at the clock for an hour? Why are we watching clock tick on an holiday.‚Äù

The thing is, I have done all the things mentioned above. I have always chosen scrolling on my phone over going for a walk, always chosen daydreaming and watching motivational videos instead of actually doing the things I want to do, like paragliding or going on a solo trek. I've always had excuses because there are other easier tasks to do. I have messed up my dopamine receptors in the brain, so getting them back is difficult. Thus, I have begun forcing my brain to do boring tasks like staring at the clock, which gives basically no dopamine. I want to show my brain I am still in control and can do tasks even if it doesn't want to.

So, I began my dopamine detox journey a few weeks back but decided to keep a journal about it. Here is my journey so far:

1. Daily meditation.
2. Weekly one-day phone switch-off; I don't receive any important calls, so no worries.
3. Go for a walk daily.
4. Do tasks that give less dopamine, like staring at the clock, reading terms and conditions, or, above all, dare I say, the most boring thing a person can do in the world: practice law. How people willingly practice law is beyond my understanding.
5. Write a weekly blog or journal.

Enough about myself. So why did my brain doze off, start craving the phone, want to do boring tasks, or randomly think of old memories I didn't know existed.

Basically, all this tasks give more dopamine than staring at the DAMN CLOCK!!!!!! NEVER DOING IT AGAIN SO IF YOU LET ME, I WILL GO BACK TO SCOLLING MY PHONE. BYE
