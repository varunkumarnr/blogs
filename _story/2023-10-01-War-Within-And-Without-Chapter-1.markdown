I awoke, my eyes fluttering open to the soft symphony of morning light caressing my face. The clock on the wall showed 7:30, and the world was already in motion. The window beside me was wide open, inviting in the calm morning air that brushed gently against my face. The curtains danced gracefully in the breeze, casting playful shadows across the room. As I sat up in bed, my gaze wandered to the corkboard filled with letters between Alisha and me. These weren't just letters; they were conversations, witnesses to moments of joy, sorrow, and secrets too precious to say in words.

Words had always been my struggle, ever since my solitary upbringing. Before Alisha, I had only known solitude and loneliness. I lost my parents at the tender age of seven, their lives claimed by an accident. My refuge came in the form of an aunt, a lovely woman, but her life was marred by the constant presence of her abusive husband. Every night, I would hear her go to sleep, with tears silently streaming down her face due to my uncle's abuse. I stood helpless, a witness to her silent suffering. This helplessness troubled me to this day.

Unfortunately, my aunt had passed away five years ago, when I was in the third year of grad school. To escape the harsh reality of abuse and my tragic childhood, I sought solace in the world of computers. By the age of 13, I made it into the local news as a "Child computer prodigy" for jailbreaking into a local radio station to play my favorite songs. At the age of 17, I made the news again for hacking into a government database that contained sensitive information about citizens. I would have been jailed if I were not a minor. I got out lucky this time, on the condition that I would tell the government how exactly I got into the database and provide a fix for it. I gladly agreed. In addition, I also received a full scholarship to the country's prestigious "Adalaya University," the finest university in the country. Later, I got an opportunity to work with the "Adalaya Intelligence Agency," a government agency where I worked on top-of-the-line technology and war equipment.

Footsteps approached, interrupting my reflections. I quickly adjusted the blankets and left the room to find Alisha; she worked as a pilot for "Ada Airlines."

"Look who has finally decided to wake up," Alisha teased, wooden spoon in hand.

"Someone had to ensure you didn't fly off without breakfast,"

"If you were a few more minutes late, I would have flown on an empty tummy."

"I can't help it. It's not easy being a genius and carrying this massive head on my shoulders all day. I know you can't relate, but I need those extra hours of sleep."

Alisha leaned in closer, tapping the wooden spoon on my head. "Well, Genius! If you don't move, you lazy bum, and get ready in 10 minutes, you'll be working hungry today."

I stepped into our master bathroom, its proximity to our bedroom making it a convenient start to the day. Alisha, my beloved, had already returned to the kitchen to complete our morning feast. I had a quick, steamy shower and made my way toward the kitchen to greet Alisha, my steps echoing softly on the wooden stairs. As I made my way, Her sweet hum reached my ears. She always hummed in sweet, angelic tone while in the kitchen; she says it helps add to the flavor.

As I entered the kitchen, a feast awaited me on our dining table. I could smell the delicous aroras of the pancakes. Alisha as always been an amazing cook.

"Another day of thanking God for blessing me with an amazing wife who can cook," I mused. "The smell of these pancakes could even tempt Diogenes to dine."

"I am glad you like them. You need all the energy you can get to carry the so-called brain of yours, Genius!" Alisha teased, placing pancakes on our plates. We sat down to eat, and as usual, I turned on news the radio.

> "Welcome! The date is April 12, 1966, and you are tuned in to Adalaya's number one radio channel and news source. Welcome to FM radio 97.2, and I am your host, Emma. On today's morning news, tensions have reached an unprecedented level between Adalaya and Veridia. This comes as both countries approach their respective national days tomorrow, and there's growing speculation among experts about the potential for a declaration of war.<br> <br>Let's turn our attention to Dr. Steven Hawks, a distinguished professor of political science at the University of Adalaya and an authority on this matter. Dr. Hawks, could you kindly provide our new listeners with the background of this conflict?.<br> <br>Certainly, Emma. First, I want to express my gratitude for the warm welcome. This conflict, often referred to as a 'cold war,' has persisted for the past 35 years, even preceding the division of Veridala into the present-day nations of Veridia and Adalaya, a transformation that took place three decades ago.<br> <br>Thirty-five years ago, our esteemed leader, Benjamin Eack, secured his fifth and final term as president. A man of noble character and profound intellect, he elevated Veridala from the depths of destitution into a global powerhouse during his 25-year presidency. His tireless dedication earned the admiration of the populace, resulting in a remarkable victory in the 1931 elections, where he garnered a staggering 98% majority against the opposition. This triumph proved so decisive that it led to the dissolution of opposing parties, marking the transformation of our nation from a democracy into a dictatorship, consolidating power in a single individual and party. We lost our power to choose our leader, and the people lost their power. The Eack family gained all the power. During his final years, Sir Benjamin, weakened by age and illness, sought to pass on the mantle of leadership to one of his twin sons, Brendon Eack and Steve Eack. The dilemma arose when both sons harbored ambitions to become the supreme leader, following in their father's footsteps. In the event of non-selection, they even threatened to establish an opposition party. <br> <br>Witnessing the escalating discord between his sons and fearing the unraveling of his hard-earned legacy, Sir Benjamin implemented the division of Veridala into two distinct entities: Veridia, a thriving urban landscape at the forefront of technological progress, and Adalaya, a cultural haven amidst an agricultural landscape characterized by mountains, avian life, and breathtaking natural beauty. Sir Benjamin also made both sons sign a trade agreement for the next 10 years so that Veridia wouldn't suffer from hunger and Adalaya wouldn't lag behind in technological advancements. Since there was no opposition party, and the people had lost their power, the separation didn't face any resistance. <br> <br>In 1937, Sir Benjamin passed away and was laid to rest in Verupa, the territory situated between the two nations. His death anniversary is commemorated as National Day in both countries, where both presidents converge in Verupa to pay homage to their father. Verupa, a land unaffiliated with either nation, has become the focal point of tension, as both brothers seek to assert their supremacy by gaining power over this land, further fueling the conflict. Over the past three decades, both Veridia and Adalaya have made remarkable strides, emerging as global juggernauts that are self-reliant and no longer dependent on external trade. As tensions continue to escalate, both nations have poured substantial resources into strengthening their military forces, with Veridia boasting the best air force in the world and Adalaya maintaining the most formidable land army. Looking at all the signs, it seems that war is inevitable" concluded Dr. Hawks
