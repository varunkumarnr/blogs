## Introduction

Take a moment to look around you. You'll notice an array of objects, each serving a distinct purpose. A phone exists for communication, a book imparts knowledge, a water bottle stores hydration, a house provides shelter, and a car facilitates travel. In the realm of human-made creations, the "why" of existence is apparent and easy to answer.

Now, shift your focus to the natural world. Birds, for instance, serve as pollinators, seed dispersers, and insect predators. Animals, distributed across various stages within the food chain, fulfill essential roles that contribute to the balance of their ecosystems. If you were to inquire about the existence of a particular organism, I could provide you with multiple answers, some from scientific understanding and others shaped by philosophical perspectives.

Yet, as we extend our inquiries beyond our planet and into the vast cosmos, we encounter numerous unanswerable questions: Why does the universe exist? How did it come into being from what seems like nothingness? Who or what is responsible for its creation? Unlike the everyday objects and living beings we encounter, the existence of the universe confronts us with questions that lack easy answers.

## So why do we need to know "why" universe exists?

Knowing the answer to why the universe exists can shed light on the question of why you and I exist. There are two possible reasons for my and the universe and our exitance.First, we may exist simply because we exist, without any other reason. Second, there may be a higher purpose for the universe and my existence. The first possibility seems boring and does not make us feel particularly special. So, we are inclined to embrace the second possibility. Therefore, let's embark on an exploration of the question: Why does the universe exist?

Before addressing the "why" of the universe's existence, let's first consider the "how." There are numerous theories that explain the existence of the universe, with the Big Bang theory being the most widely accepted and agreed-upon explanation in the scientific community. It stats that quantum fluctuations in the early cosmos led to rapid inflation, subsequently giving rise to atoms, planets, and everything we observe today. However, it's crucial to note that the Big Bang theory primarily explains the evolution and development of the universe, rather than its ultimate origin. Like Stephan Hawking said in his book " A Brief History of Time",

> Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?

While Science offers anseers to "how's", addressing the "why" or the "fire" to answer these we need to go into the realms of philosophy and religion.

**Religious Belief**: Differnet Religious have different answers to "why" universe exists, Hindhism stats "Brahma" created the universe and that the universe is cyclic that the ultimate goal is spirtual evolution or moksha. While in Christianity, God created the universe out of love and with a divine purpose. The purpose may include the revelation of God's nature, the expression of divine creativity, and the creation of a context for the moral and spiritual development of sentient beings. In Islam, the universe's existence is seen as part of God's divine plan, and its purpose may include serving as a test for human beings.

**Philosophy Belief**: Similarly, in the realm of philosophy, there are various beliefs regarding the existence of the universe. One concept that has gained significant attention in recent times is simulation theory. This philosophical idea proposes that our reality, including the entire universe, might be a computer simulation or virtual construct created by advanced beings or entities.

For both of these possibilities to hold true, a significant number of assumptions must be considered. In the case of the Religious theory, often associated with the concept of a divine creator or "God," certain prerequisites come into play. Firstly, there must indeed exist a Divine Being, and this entity must have had a purpose when creating the universe. Furthermore, this Divine Being should know everything, be powerful and have good morals. It is also implied that humans must be capable of comprehending the goals of this Divine Being for the act of creation to be deemed successful. Additionally, the acceptance of various spiritual realities, including concepts such as reincarnation, the existence of an afterlife, and the notion of spiritual evolution, must hold true for us to inhabit a universe shaped by such beliefs.

For simulation theory to be true, Firstly, there must exist one or more advanced civilizations with the capacity to construct computers capable of simulating conscious beings. These civilizations would then proceed to create a multitude of simulated universes, outnumbering the real ones, which leads to the hypothesis that we are more likely to exist within one of these simulated realities.

According to Occam's razor principle, I would argue that the Simulation Theory appears to be more similar to and feasible than the Divine Theory.

## My thoughts on why Simulation theory is not as crazy as it sounds.

I know simulation theory raises numerous questions. The primary assumption we must make with simulation theory is that the first civilization, the one that created or will create the simulation, is natural, real, and formed by natural processes. Another question that arises is: Why would any simulation waste resources and energy to simulate a less intelligent version of themselves? If you have this same question, I believe you're mistaken. Having a simulation that is similar to you is like having a development environment before trying things in the real world. You never ask a tech company why they are wasting resources on development environments.

Imagine you're building a house and want to see what would happen to that house if an 8-magnitude earthquake strikes. You can just see it in the simulation because people in the simulation are less intelligent, and they would not even realize it. You can experiment with new ideas and learn more about yourself by observing the simulation. Simulations can also act as a source of entertainment. Imagine a 24/7 reality show featuring the simulation; the whole world would be watching it. I think we humans will make our own version of a simulation; it's just a matter of when.

So now we see that having a simulation is not as bad an idea as we might think. The question arises: Are we living in a simulation? The answer to that question is that there is a higher probability that we are in a simulation than in an actual, real universe.Imagine a first universe, created through natural processes, that creates a simulation. The natural world is L1, and their simulation is L2. Now, L2 creates their own simulation, L3. In this scenario, there are two simulated universes and one natural universe. It's more likely that you are a part of a simulation than a natural civilization. In the actual scenario, there could be millions of levels of simulations, and each level can have multiple simulations. So, there is a very high probability that you're in a simulation rather than a natural civilization.

Now that we consider the possibility that we might be living in a simulation, several questions arise: Is it feasible to have enough computational power to simulate the entire universe? Can conscious and intelligent beings be created through coding? And, is it possible to construct a world that is indistinguishable from reality?

To answer the first question, yes, I believe we could have enough computation to simulate an entire universe. According to Moore's Law, which was stated in 1965, computation doubles approximately every two years. While this doubling has slowed slightly over the years, it is still true that computation is growing at an exponential rate.

Regarding the second question, it is possible to create computers smarter than ourselves. Many scientists believe there will be a point of singularity where computers surpass human intelligence, and this singularity is expected to occur before 2050. Therefore, it is possible to create simulations that host intelligent entities. However, the concept of creating conscious beings remains a matter of debate, as we still do not fully understand consciousness. Nevertheless, given the rate of human progress, it is conceivable that humans may find a way to create conscious entities like ourselves.

As for the third question, is it possible to construct a world indistinguishable from reality? Yes, it is. Just consider the progression in video games over the years; some modern games come remarkably close to reality in terms of graphics and simulation. Furthermore, there may be no necessity to create a universe indistinguishable from reality, as beings within simulations would never have the means to know what is reality. For example, A character from GTA if he is conscious would belive gta world is real world as he would not know what real world looks like.

## What are some things we can see in our would to say we are in simulation?

**Presence of Constants**:
Take a moment to look around, and you'll notice that our world is filled with mathematical constants. It's almost as if someone meticulously placed these values after extensive research. For example, consider the speed of light, which stands at 299,792,458 meters per second. It dictates that nothing can surpass this speed. Could it be that this constant was set precisely to optimize computational processes? What if Going faster than this speed might lead loading screen, as the computational abilities of our creators might not be sufficient to render at such high speeds.
Now, let's explore the other end of the spectrum: Planck's length, a distance beyond which two objects cannot be distinguished or measured. As we look around, our reality is structured with thousands of such constants, including the Gravitational Constant, Boltzmann's Constant, Fine-Structure Constant, and more, all finely tuned to make our existence possible. The question that naturally arises is, who fine-tuned these constants? Is it merely a coincidence? Scientifically, this fine-tuning is explained in the multiverse theory, which posits the existence of all possible universes with various sets of constants. We happen to inhabit one of these finely tuned universes. However, it's worth noting that the multiverse theory, like many others, lacks concrete scientific proof. Saying it is just a coincidence that we live in such a finely tuned universe is like trying to hit a target in Mars bullseye from your home on earth it outrageous claim.

**Our Universe is Mathamatical and Procedural**:

Our universe operates procedurally, which means it can be thought of as following a set of rules like a computer program. Everything in the universe is ultimately made up of the same basic building blocks: quarks and electrons. We can even create a step-by-step algorithm to describe how the universe came into existence. It's like a series of instructions, where each step depends on the output of the previous one. For instance, if we want to simulate how atoms formed, we'd start with the first 380,000 years of the Big Bang theory when quarks transformed into protons and neutrons, combining with electrons to create atoms. This same idea applies to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets—all following specific procedures or rules.

Each of these procedures or rules can be explained using mathematics. Many scientists argue that mathematics is the universal language of the universe. Interestingly, computers are particularly good at handling mathematical calculations compared to humans. It's remarkable how our universe seems to follow mathematical patterns so perfectly. Some scientists even believe there might be a single formula capable of explaining everything in the universe, just waiting to be discovered. When we consider how mathematically precise our universe is, the idea that this one formula emerged by pure coincidence seems quite unusual.

**Our Universe is bounded by rules?**

Our universe seems to have its own set of rules, dictating what we can and cannot do, and only allowing us to explore specific points in space. It's as if we're in a strict household, bound by rules with limited freedom. In my view, if our universe were entirely natural, we should be able to do whatever we want. For example, we understand time as our fourth dimension (although it might be an illusion), but going backward in time appears impossible. Additionally, many galaxies are moving away from us faster than the speed of light, making it impossible for us to reach them. We are also aware of only a portion of the complete universe because the light from distant regions has not yet reached us. If our existence is a natural outcome, shouldn't that imply the existence of other intelligent species formed in a similar manner? Yet, we have never encountered any. Our universe is build on sets of this rules.

## Now that you know your in simulation what next?

First, we must try to uncover the purpose for which our creators have invested resources to create both us and the universe we inhabit. What could this purpose be? Is it for entertainment? I don't think so, we are boring AF. Is it for experimentation? Perhaps, but then why create an entire universe when a simpler setup for experimentation would suffice?

One possibility is that our goal is to create another simulation, continuing the simulation cycle. Therefore, let's go out learn something useful so we can reach our goal before our creators decide we are hopeless and shut down the simulation.

## Conclusion

**We are just lab rats and there is nothing we can do about it.**
