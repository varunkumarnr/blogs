We had books filled with the stories of our future,
you burned them before we can even start a chapter.
Our plans were grand, ambitious but they were always together,
How can I accomplish them without your arm on my shoulder.

Every moment we spend, every walk we had felt like stuff made in dreams,
But now I only see you in dream.
You read all my writings with a smile, and promised you will always be there,
I would write thousand poems, just to walk another mile.

It was our first Valentine, you wore a beautiful long red gown,
Your smile made the fresh roses look dull,
You took the flowers, told they smell wonderful,
I thought I just found an angel.

The same face that put a smile, now made my breathe weak,
Your angelic voice is now distinct,
your everyday messages are now just memories,
been a year but **still hurts the same**, now I don't have your shoulder to cry upon.

I know you have moved on with someone new,
my friends tell me I should do the same,
Little do they know, that i still have a part of you,
How did you kill the part of me?
