Hello mere mortals,

**Guess what I am immortal**, and science agrees with me. Before you get confused and ask, I would like to confirm that I am neither God nor crazy. So, you might be wondering, how the heck am I immortal, you ask?

Before you start getting jealous of my immortal life and start wishing you were me, I would like to give you some good news: you are immortal, too. Okay, let me explain the story how I found this forbidden truth, before you call a doctor to check on me.

All of us are made of atoms, and atoms are made of quarks and electrons basic elementary physics stuff, right?. Now here is where things get basic to crazy: all elementary particles, like quarks, electrons, and photons, can be a wave and a particle at the same time also known as **wave-particle duality**.

How do I know this? Well, that's the good part—I don't know, but this experiment says it's true, so it must be true. It's called the double-slit experiment, and it goes like this: Consider this thought experiment. You need a double slit, a screen, and an electron beam gun or a photon beam gun. The experiment setup requires you to have 10 photon beam guns. Place your double slit in the middle and the screen at the opposite end like this:

![1.1 Enivronment Setup](../images/env_setup_doubleslit.png)

So, what do you think will be the pattern on the screen? Any sane human like me would say we would get two light patterns corresponding to two slits, like the image on the right in 1.2, right? In other words, a photon is a particle and goes through one of the slits to hit the screen.

![1.2 What you think will happen](../images/doubleslit_particle.png)

If you thought the same thing, you're wrong. What you actually observe is something like the pattern below. You get an interference pattern as if a photon/light is a wave(Differnent colors representing different wavelength). So, that's it, right? Light is a wave and not a particle.

![1.3 Actual Result](../images/doubleslit_actual.png)

Things get stranger here. Scientists thought this pattern might be because of light particles interfering with each other, and light is not actually a wave. So what do they do? They remove the 10 guns and replace them with one gun, firing one by one (using a light bulb image because I'm bad at drawing). Still, they get the same pattern. Hmm, if you're like me, you might be wondering how one photon can go through multiple slits and produce an interference pattern, right?

![1.4 Single electron](../images/Wave_one_photon_double_slit.jpg)

Okay, now things are clear. Light is a wave, and a wave can pass through both slits at the same time. The point where two waves interfere at the other side produces the interference pattern, right? Job done. Now, things go from crazy to 'what the hell are you talking about?' Scientists wanted to observe if truly the photon is passing through both slits, so they added an observer to the above experiment.

![1.5 Observer added to double slit](../images/double_slit_observer.png)

Alright, now that we've added the observer, let's rerun the same experiment. So, what do we get this time? You might think we'd still get the same interference pattern, right? Nope. Now, we see two light patterns on the screen (in the case of multiple photons fired at same time, only one pattern on the screen if only one poton particle is fired as it passes through only one slit), just like in image 1.2, as if light were a particle once again. So, without an observer, light was behaving like a wave, but as soon as you observe it, it suddenly acts like a particle. So, what are you, light? A wave or a particle?

I know what you're thinking, Varun! What does a photon, electron, or a quark being both a particle and a wave have to do with me being immortal? Trust me, it does. It's like the saying 'You have to eat your vegetables before getting to the meaty part'; you need this knowledge so you don't think I'm crazy. Okay, let's get back to the story. How does a wave become a particle once it's observed? Let's take another step back: What does a photon being a wave mean? We fire a beam of photons, so how do they become waves? This is where quantum mechanics and Erwin Schrödinger come into the picture. Until the photons are observed, they exist in a superposition. It states that photons are not in one position but in a probability of all positions, and once measured, they collapse into one position. These positions are represented by the wave function. So, photons are in superposition; they can be in multiple states at the same time. _So, what this means is that quantum particles don't have any set properties until they're observed. It's like in video games, where the world's properties only load when they are at your point of view. See I have been telling you we are in simulation no one belives_.

I know all of it sounds like gibberish, so let's take an example. Imagine you're in your house, and you've lost your cat. You know it's somewhere in your house, and based on your experience, you know there are certain places where it's more likely to be (like on the couch or the bed). So, you create a 'cat function' for your house: a map that shows the likelihood of your cat being at different places. Places it loves get a high likelihood, and places it despises get a close-to-zero likelihood. A wave function in quantum mechanics is somewhat similar. Instead of your cat, we're mapping all the possible positions (and speeds and other properties) a quantum particle can occupy in space.

But here's the crucial quantum weirdness: until you actually look (measure), the particle doesn't have a definite position or speed. It's not that we don't know; it's that it genuinely doesn't have a definite value. It's in a 'superposition' of many possible states all at once. It's like your cat could be in any possible location in the house until you find it. But once you find the cat, your wave function collapses, and it becomes a particle. The cat is suddenly only in one position, and you know exactly where it is. Also, in quantum mechanics, the cat isn't in just one of the possible spots but in all of the possible spots. Just like how a single photon can go through both possible slits.Yep, that's right; I just said it, and you read it right. The single cat is at multiple spots at the same time until it's measured. So if your like me you might ask, forget about immortality what the hell happened to all my other cats once the cat position is measured? What do you mean all my cats collapsed?.

So, the burning question that even made scientists scratch their heads when they first heard this theory: Are there really multiple cats, or are they just messing with us? You know, like when you lose a coin, and every time you look for it, it's in a different place? It's like the universe is playing a game of hide and seek with itself.
Now, let's talk about this collapse thing. What's causing it? Are the cats actually collapsing, or are they just really good at disappearing when you're not looking? Niels Bohr and Erwin Schrödinger teamed up and came up with the 'Copenhagen interpretation.' According to this theory, when you measure the cat, it collapses into one of those random spots, like your coin magically picking a new hiding place each time.

But not everyone was on board with this idea. Einstein, the guy with the wild hair from your favrate cartoon shoes, wasn't buying it. He famously said, 'God doesn't play dice with the world.' That's right; he thought the universe had a master plan, not just random outcomes. This whole idea of our perfect world being the result of cosmic dice rolls didn't sit well with many scientists.

So, here comes another idea to the rescue, ready to sweep away all that randomness and collapse stuff—the 'Many-Worlds Theory.' If you thought the 'Copenhagen interpretation' was crazy, well, you're in for a wild ride. Remember those lost cats? Now, let's see what happens to all those other cats in this theory. Yay, you found your cat again, and like magic, all the other cats disappear, just as usual. So, what on Earth happens to them? Consider all the possible places your cat could be, to be the couch and the bed. Before you find your cat, it's in both spots, and then you finnaly find it on the couch. So, what about the cat that was in the bed? Well, here's where things get interesting. This theory claims that the cat in the bed is still there, but once you find your cat on the couch, the world splits into parallel universes. In the other branched universe, 'you' will find the missing cat in the bed. So the all cats defined by your cat function are safe.

So, where are all these parallel universes, and why can't we see them? Well, it turns out that all these parallel universes hang out in a place called 'Hilbert space.' The reason we can't see them is because Hilbert space is incredibly complex. Its dimensionality is believed to be on the order of 10^10^112. Just to put that in perspective, the total number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated to be around 10^80. Our human eyes, however, are like three-dimensional glasses at a 4D movie – they can't quite handle the full spectacle. In a sense, these parallel universes could be right here, coexisting with our reality, but we simply don't have the ability to perceive them due to their mind-bogglingly high-dimensional nature. Oh, and by the way, Hilbert space is where the wave function hangs out before it decides to collapse, split, or do whatever it does in there.

Okay, that should be enough lore to prove that you're immortal. Now that you've got all the required backstories, it's time to find out the truth about your immortality. Let's embark on yet another experiment– I know, Varun, another experiment? Boo! But trust me, this is the only way to settle the matter. Otherwise, your mortal, or should I say immortal, brains just won't get it. Imagine this: It's just another day, and you're in your lab, donning your scientist hat. You've just discovered a way to show the world that you're immortal. All you need is a quantum gun and yourself. This quantum gun is a nifty contraption. It uses the state of electrons to decide whether to fire a bullet or just click without firing.Clockwise spin, and the gun fires with a satisfying 'bang,' and your head is taken out. Anticlockwise spin, and it just clicks, letting out a 'click.' and you survive. These sounds are our observations or measurements. Now, picture this: You run the experiment ten times. What should you hear during that time? Well, it should be something like 'click, click, bang, bang, bang, click, bang, click, click, click,' or some other similar pattern. But here's the twist – instead, all you hear is 'click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,click.' You start to wonder if the gun is even working. In frustration, you fire it somewhere other than your head, and lo and behold, you hear that long-awaited 'bang.' You get back to expirement, you repeat this experiment a good 50 times, and every single time, all you hear are those damn clicks and not a sight of the bang that will rip your head out. So, you never died. Are you immortal, you wonder? or Did the expirement just fail?

You sat down, frustrated, and pondered why the experiment failed. You recollected all the details of the experiment; you had fired the quantum gun more times than you could count. So why did you only hear 'click' every time, and the one time you didn't have the gun against your head, you heard a 'bang'? It's not like the gun isn't working. As a scientist, you knew that your quantum gun operates depending on the state of the electron. Since electrons are quantum particles, you knew they would be in a superposition of being fired (clockwise) and just clicking (anticlockwise) until you measure them. According to the many-worlds interpretation, you'd be in both worlds after each measurement – in one, the electron is clockwise, and you die, and in another, the electron is anticlockwise, and you survive.But here's the perplexing part: you did measure it after every trigger, and yet you always ended up in a parallel universe where you only heard the 'click' and stayed alive, even though you tried more than 50 times. So, is it just luck? The probability of getting 50 clicks in a row is a mind-bogglingly tiny 8.8817842 × 10^(-16), so it's definitely not luck. So what on Earth happened?"

After you trigger it, you're in a superposition of being both dead and alive until you observe it. But here's the catch: you observe the sound, and you're always alive. So, why haven't you died? It's quite simple – you're not conscious enough to observe the 'bang' sound because you're already dead before your consciousness processes the sound. In essence, you're only aware of the universe where you're alive and conscious. Does that make you immortal? Kind off, You may not know that you've died, the people in the universe have lost you. Your only knowledge is that you're alive and seemingly immortal because your consciousness can only observe this universe.

I know all of this may sound unreal, but the essence of quantum immortality is that you never experience death because you lack the knowledge of it. So, you perpetually think of yourself as immortal, no matter how many times you repeat the experiment. However, there's a catch – immortality comes with specific conditions: You must die before your consciousness becomes aware enough to observe it. Unfortunately, the majority of deaths in the real world do not align with this condition. The death should be instant. This is also why you dont see people immortal or really old in real world as most deaths are not instant.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, now that you have the knowledge, it's up to you to decide whether you consider yourself immortal or not. And if you don't fully understand the blog, don't worry. **Always remember that there is a version of you in another universe that read this blog and understood everything**.
