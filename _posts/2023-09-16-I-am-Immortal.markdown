Hello mere mortals,

Guess what I am immortal, and science agrees with me. Before you get confused and ask, I would like to confirm that I am not God and not crazy, as far as I know. So, you might be wondering, how the heck am I immortal, you ask?

Before you start getting jealous of my immortal life and start wishing you were me, I would like to give you some good news: you are immortal, too. Okay, let me explain the story before you call a doctor to check on me.

All of us are made of atoms, and atoms are made of quarks and electrons (basic elementary physics stuff, right?). Now here is where things get basic to crazy: all elementary particles, like quarks, electrons, and photons, can be a wave and a particle at the same time also known as wave-particle duality.

How do I know this? Well, that's the good partâ€”I don't know, but this experiment says it's true, so it must be true. It's called the double-slit experiment, and it goes like this: Consider this thought experiment. You need a double slit, a screen, and an electron beam gun or a photon beam gun. The experiment setup requires you to have 10 photon beam guns. Place your double slit in the middle and the screen at the opposite end like this:

![1.1 Enivronment Setup](../images/env_setup_doubleslit.png)

So, what do you think will be the pattern on the screen? Any sane human like me would say we would get two light patterns corresponding to two slits, like the image on the right in 1.2, right? In other words, a photon is a particle and goes through one of the slits to hit the screen.

![1.2 What you think will happen](../images/doubleslit_particle.png)

If you thought the same thing, you're wrong. What you actually observe is something like the pattern below. You get an interference pattern as if a photon/light is a wave. So, that's it, right? Light is a wave and not a particle.

![1.3 Actual Result](../images/doubleslit_actual.png)

Things get stranger here. Scientists thought this pattern might be because of light particles interfering with each other, and light is not actually a wave. So what do they do? They remove the 10 guns and replace them with one gun, firing one by one (using a light bulb image because I'm bad at drawing). Still, they get the same pattern. Hmm, if you're like me, you might be wondering how one photon can go through multiple slits and produce an interference pattern, right?

![1.4 Single electron](../images/Wave_one_photon_double_slit.jpg)

Okay, now things are clear. Light is a wave, and a wave can pass through both slits at the same time. The point where two waves interfere at the other side produces the interference pattern, right? Job done. Now, things go from crazy to 'what the hell are you talking about?' Scientists wanted to observe if truly the photon is passing through both slits, so they added an observer to the above experiment.

![1.5 Observer added to double slit](../images/double_slit_observer.png)

Alright, now that we've added the observer, let's rerun the same experiment. So, what do we get this time? You might think we'd still get the same interference pattern, right? Nope. Now, we see two light patterns on the screen (in the case of multiple photons fired at same time, only one pattern on the screen if only one poton particle is fired as it passes through only one slit), just like in image 1.2, as if light were a particle once again. So, without an observer, light was behaving like a wave, but as soon as you observe it, it suddenly acts like a particle. So, what are you, light? A wave or a particle?

I know what you're thinking, Varun! What does a photon, electron, or a quark being both a particle and a wave have to do with me being immortal? Trust me, it does. It's like the saying 'You have to eat your vegetables before getting to the meaty part'; you need this knowledge so you don't think I'm crazy. Okay, let's get back to the story. How does a wave become a particle once it's observed? Lets Take an other step back what does photon being a wave mean?
