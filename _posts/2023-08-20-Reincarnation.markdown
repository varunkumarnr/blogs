## Introduction

Imagine a universe where you wake up every morning in a new body, but with the same unchanging personality. Today, you are a fierce lion ruling the jungle; tomorrow, your tree on a mountaintop; and the day after, a dolphin leaping through the waves. Each day brings a fresh physical form, but your sense of self remains consistent, leading to a collection of lifetimes that would make even the best actor jealous. This is the idea of reincarnation, where your deeds from the previous day decide your form today. Even for a movie plot, the idea would be ridiculous, but this is what the majority of us believe in.

##### **Where did the idea orignate from? (Where I learnt it from)**

I do not know the original origin of reincarnation, but I learned the concept from Hindu and Buddhist ideologies. Below are the definations according to both idealogies.

In **Hinduism**, reincarnation is the belief that the soul undergoes a continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The ultimate goal of Hinduism is to break free from this cycle by achieving moksha, which is liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. The process of reincarnation is guided by the law of karma, which states that a person's actions in one life determine the circumstances and experiences of their future lives. The soul is believed to take on different physical bodies based on its accumulated karma. The goal is to attain spiritual purity and enlightenment through various lifetimes, ultimately leading to liberation.

In **Buddhism**, reincarnation is also known as the cycle of birth and death, However, unlike Hinduism, Buddhism views the cycle of reincarnation as inherently unsatisfactory and seeks to break free from it through the attainment of enlightenment, The cycle of reincarnation is driven by ignorance and attachment, which lead to suffering. The concept of no-self in Buddhism challenges the notion of a permanent, unchanging soul. Instead, it is believed that what continues from one life to another are not fixed souls, but rather a stream of consciousness, mental and karmic elements. The goal in Buddhism is to cease this cycle of rebirth by understanding the nature of reality and the cessation of craving and attachment.

**tldr**: Hinduism says soul performs the cycle wheras, In buddhism there is No fixed soul, but a stream of consciousness and elements. In Hinduism, Karma drives cycle and cycle continues till you reach enligtment or your perfect?(guess). In Buddhism, desire drives cycle and continues till you have no desire or attachments.

### Why I dont think reincaranation is real.

Let me make it clear that when I say I do not believe in reincarnation, I mean that I do not believe in the concept that my previous life's deeds influence my current life. I do not believe that there is a supercomputer somewhere that keeping record of every desire or bad deed that I do, and that The concept of gaining enlightenment or enjoying an afterlife is based on these recorded actions is not part of my worldview.

I do believe that when you die, you decompose and that your atoms or energy are used by different living organisms. For example, fertilizers, plants, food for microscopic life, or scavengers.

Let's imagine I'm open to the idea of reincarnation and believe that my actions affect my next lives. If that's the case, would being born as a tree for my first life in this cycle give me a better shot at gaining enlightenment compared to being born as a human? This is because trees might have fewer wants or actions, which could lead to a more spiritually positive life.
Now, let's think about being born as a mayfly, which only lives for 24 hours. During that short time, there's no chance to eat, drink, or have strong desires. The main purpose is to reproduce before passing away. This quick life might help me finish the cycle fast and enjoy an eternal afterlife. As my lifespan would be so short I dont have time to do bad deeds or have desires. I dint even talk about microscopic organisms whos life span is so small they do not have time to think about doing bad deeds.

In the above mentioned sceniorio my pathway to ending life cycle and going to havens depends on which life form I talk in early life cycle. **For simiplicty and above mentioned reasons, let me say reincarnation only applys to humans**, The earliest documented human life dates back 300,000 years ago, while ape-like organisms (our ancestors) emerged approximately 4 million years ago. On the other hand, unicellular life began on Earth over a billion years ago. To provide context, Earth's age is estimated at around 4.5 billion years. Does this imply that the concept of souls only came into existence after the first documented humans appeared on Earth?(only keeping it earth because I do not if other planets have life ü§ì üòè).

Alright, I'll entertain the notion that souls somehow magically emerged only after the first humans or ape-like creatures around 4 million years ago. Perhaps it took some time to develop the supercomputer capable of meticulously tracking every deed üòõ, or maybe just that souls were evolved as a part of human evolution.

**Following are the real reasons I do not belive in reincarnation**(Please dont start reading from here or you will think I have wrong idea of reincarnation).

**varying total population**: According to me, for reincarnation to work, the human population should grow constantly. That is, a few new souls are created (I don't know how), a few souls that are enlightened go to heaven, and the remaining souls remain in the population. So, it should be:

```html
Total Population at anytime = Number of new Souls + Total Number of remaining
souls - Number of souls that ended cycle
```

So, according to the above equation, the population increases if the number of new souls created is greater than the number of souls that have ended their cycle. Conversely, the population decreases if the number of souls that have ended their cycle is greater than the number of new souls created.
Let's look at a few centuries with the slowest population growth or decline in population. Theoretically, this should be the time frame when humans live the happiest life, right?

| Years with slowest population / decline in population | Reason                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 14 the century                                        | Black plague and Europe 100 years war |
| 17th Century                                          | Wars                                  |
| 18 the century                                        | wars                                  |

Throughout history, we have seen that the population growth rate is lowest when there have been wars or outbreaks of diseases whose cause is unknown. Let's look at the other side. When has the population growth been highest? That is, when has the number of people who have ended their life cycle been the lowest? This should be the cruelest time, right? The highest population growth was between the late 20th and early 21st centuries because there were no wars, a stable economy, and agriculture.

So we see Population should is increasing when people are most happy. According to this logic easiest way to go get enlightenment is starting a war. There it is, I have answered an impossible question.

**Mutiverse**: I acknowledge that the concept of a multiverse is controversial and lacks empirical proof. Nevertheless, I hold the belief in its existence as it can be inferred from other established laws; hence, I belive it üòè. According to the multiverse theory, the universe is infinite, as universe is infinite there is possibilty of infinte versions of you. In one universe, you could embody the qualities of a saint, devoid of mistakes or desires. In contrast, in another universe, you might assume the role of a corrupt politician, driven by insatiable desires. Moreover, in one universe, you may no longer be living, while in another, you could thrive for a remarkable century. Do individuals possess multiple souls for each distinct version of themselves? Alternatively, could there be multiple manifestations of the same soul? If so, how does the process of reincarnation unfold? Does it transpire after the demise of every iteration of oneself? Additionally, how does the intricate balance of karma manifest across these countless versions of existence? Could a heightened state of enlightenment be attained if a majority of these versions accumulate positive karma? Presence of reincarrnation raises more questions than it solves.

**Physics laws violation**: The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change forms. In the context of reincarnation, if a soul is believed to be a form of energy, the question arises: where does the energy come from for each new life? If a soul is a form of energy, then the energy required for a new life would seemingly violate the principle of energy conservation.
Also this would also violate another important concept Entropy, which is a measure of the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of a closed system tends to increase over time, resulting in a decrease in the system's energy available to do useful work.
If we consider reincarnation, where a soul is transferred from one body to another, it might seem like entropy is being reset with each new life. This could appear to challenge the concept of entropy's inexorable increase.

It also violates Biological and Genetic Inheritance, Conservation of Information few concepts that we know of quantuam mechanics and other laws we know of today.

### Conclusion:

According to me, reincarnation arises from people's inability to accept the notion that there's nothing beyond death. Our bodies return borrowed atoms to the universe, and our consciousness fades unless preserved differently. I still like the concept of reincarnation and its appeal lies in its encouragement of good deeds under the notion of oversight from above. These blog is my evening thoughts, penned out of boredom, and shouldn't alter anyone's beliefs.
